### âœ¨ Suggested improvements

1. **Add prerequisites**
   (helps beginners who may not know Git basics)

   ```markdown
   > ðŸ›  Prerequisite: Youâ€™ll need Git installed and a GitHub account.
   ```

2. **Polish branch naming convention**
   Encourage descriptive branch names:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b idea/debugging-nightmares
   git checkout -b art/new-character-sketch
   ```

3. **Contribution types table**
   Easier for people to see where their work belongs:

   ```markdown
   | Contribution type   | Folder        | Example filename                  |
   |---------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
   | Comic idea (text)   | `/ideas/`    | debugging-nightmares.md           |
   | Draft / Artwork     | `/drafts/`   | character-sketch.png              |
   | Final Comic Strip   | `/comics/`   | comic-005-bug-fix-battle.png      |
   ```

4. **Add style guidelines for ideas**
   To keep submissions consistent:

   ```markdown
   ### Idea Format (for `/ideas/`)
   * **Title**: Short and catchy
   * **Premise**: 2â€“3 lines
   * **Punchline**: The joke / twist
   ```

5. **Add code of conduct link**
   Encourages healthy collaboration:

   ```markdown
   Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.
   ```
