###🚀 CodeLores is live!

After teasing with the first panel yesterday, here’s the official launch of my little dev-comic experiment. 🎨👩‍💻

💡 The idea: Take everyday coding struggles, bugs, and “aha!” moments — and turn them into comics.

This is just the beginning — more strips coming soon.

Follow along, and let me know: what’s your funniest dev moment that deserves a comic?
