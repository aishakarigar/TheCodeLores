## 🧩 Problem  
On LeetCode, “Reverse Integer” looks simple:  
👉 Take an integer, flip its digits, return the result.  

But here’s the catch: what if the reversed number overflows a 32-bit integer?  
💥 Suddenly, your program crashes.

## 💻 Code Example (C++)  

```cpp
int reverse(int x) {
    long rev = 0;
    while (x != 0) {
        rev = rev * 10 + x % 10;
        x /= 10;
        if (rev > INT_MAX || rev < INT_MIN) return 0; // overflow check
    }
    return (int)rev;
}
```

## 🌍 Real-World Connection

Think of YouTube’s view counter.
Every time a video racks up millions of views, the counter increments.

But if the system isn’t **overflow-safe**…
➡️ 2 billion views could turn into negative views or break the counter.

This tiny puzzle reflects a massive engineering challenge:
✔ Handling edge cases at scale
✔ Designing systems that fail gracefully
✔ Thinking like an engineer, not just a coder

## ⚡ Takeaway

DSA isn’t just about algorithms.
It’s about building systems that stand strong in the real world.

👉 Next time you solve a DSA problem, ask:
**“Where does this live in the real world?”**
