## 🔹 The Puzzle  

On LeetCode, “Reverse Integer” looks simple:  

- Take a signed 32-bit integer  
- Reverse its digits  
- Return the result (if it doesn’t overflow)  

Example:  

```

Input: 123
Output: 321

Input: -123
Output: -321

````

But here’s the catch—  
👉 What happens if the reversed number **overflows** a 32-bit integer?

---

## 🔹 Code Implementation (C++)  

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {
        long rev = 0;
        while (x != 0) {
            rev = rev * 10 + x % 10;
            x /= 10;
            if (rev > INT_MAX || rev < INT_MIN) return 0; 
        }
        return rev;
    }
};
````

* `INT_MAX = 2,147,483,647`
* `INT_MIN = -2,147,483,648`
* If reversing goes out of this range → **return 0**

---

## 🔹 Why This Matters

This tiny puzzle reflects a massive **engineering challenge**:

* ✔ Handling **edge cases at scale**
* ✔ Designing systems that fail gracefully
* ✔ Thinking like an **engineer, not just a coder**

---

## 🔹 Real-World Parallel

Think of **YouTube’s view counter**:

* Every view increments an integer counter
* Popular videos hit **billions of views**
* If the system isn’t overflow-safe…

  * Counters could wrap to **negative values**
  * Or the system could **crash**

Fun fact: Older versions of Minecraft once had similar bugs when block counts overflowed!

## 🔹 Takeaway

DSA isn’t just about passing coding tests.
It’s about building **systems that stand up in the real world**.

⚡ **Lesson:** Always ask yourself—
👉 “Where does this algorithm live in the real world?”

Chances are, the answer will surprise you.
